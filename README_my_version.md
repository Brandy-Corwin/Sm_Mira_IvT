# Sm_Mira_IvT
 For this project, our goal is to determine if miracidia from the liver and the intestines are transcriptomically different. If they are, we also want to identify any differentially expressed genes.

## Reduced Data vs Whole Data
 Since the data was very large, I did not have enough time to run it on the whole dataset. The reduced dataset has 10% of the data for each file. Anything with "_reduced" uses the reduced data.

## Ways to Run the Analysis
 There are two ways of running this analysis: in a jupyter notebook or through snakemake.
